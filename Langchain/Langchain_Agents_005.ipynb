language model based applications by combining what we've already learned about Model IO, Data Connections and Chains, we've actually already approached applications that we've built ourselves that are similar to agents allowing us to create more robust applications.\n","\n","https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/\n","\n","----\n","\n","***However, agents take this one step further with the ReAct framework.***\n","\n","At their core, agents allow large language models to connect to tools like using Wikipedia, a calculator, Google search and deciding between those tools, and then conduct a structured approach to complete a task.\n","\n","It's based on a paper called `'ReAct: Synergising Reasoning and Acting in Language Models'`.\n","\n","PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629.pdf\n","\n","What this paper describes is that a lot of other applications focused on\n","- Either just reasoning, so we have our language model, try to trace the reasoning for the correct answer.\n","- Or we had models that were just able to act.\n","    \n","    For example: They were able to take an action on some sort of environment and then get some observation from that.\n","\n","The react prompting tries to combine these so you have reasoning traces to your large language models that then inform what actions it should take, and then it observes the results of those actions.\n","\n","-----\n","-----\n","\n","In **Langchain implementation**, this takes the form of an agent object that has access to a list of tools.\n","\n","The agent is given a task and can reason which tools are appropriate to use and can then utilize those results or observations to continue via an internal chain until it actually solves the task that you initially asked it.\n","\n","\n","Now, internally, Langchain labels the thinking in terms of an observation, a thought, and then an action.\n","- And then the cycle repeats itself.\n","\n","So the large language model is going to have some sort of observation, it's going to think about it and then perform an action and based off the results of the action, it does another observation and continues that cycle until it feels that it solved the problem or task we gave it."],"metadata":{"id":"YPLBnWoh2k-O"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install langchain

India retained King George VI as head of state until its transition to a republic, when the Constitution of India came into effect on 26 January 1950 (celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, with the enactment of the sovereign law Constitution of India. India attained independence following the independence movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil disobedience led by Indian National Congress under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.\n","Independence coincided with the partition of India, in which British India was divided into the Dominions of India and Pakistan; the partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly 15 million people due to religious violence. On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru raised the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi. On each subsequent Independence Day, the incumbent Prime Minister customarily raises the flag and gives an address to the nation. The entire event is broadcast by Doordarshan, India's national broadcaster, and usually begins with the shehnai music of Ustad Bismillah Khan. Independence Day is observed throughout India with flag-hoisting ceremonies, parades and cultural events.
