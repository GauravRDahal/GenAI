They have met the expected targets for these tasks. However, they have identified a bottleneck in their performance, which is the inability to reach out to enough people due to a stack of priority tasks. They have suggested creating a schedule to address this issue. The milestones set for the intern include reaching out to 1000 individuals and sending 500 emails. These milestones were discussed with the team and are considered key performance indicators. The intern's performance will be assessed based on feedback and whether they are able to complete tasks on time. Both the intern and senior staff rely on each other for support. The intern acknowledges that some tasks may have a long gestation period. This performance review covers the week of August 7th to August 13th, 2023.\n",
